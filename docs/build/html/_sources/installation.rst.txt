PyMPA installation
=======================

PyMPA is a pure Python package. It runs after the installation of a virtual
environment with Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Obspy libraries.  
Some C extensions of ObsPy toolkit are also used and Bottleneck libraries.
Bottleneck is a set of functions inspired by NumPy and SciPy, but written in 
Cython with high performance in mind. Bottleneck provides separate Cython 
functions for each combination of array dimensions, axis, and data type.

We heavily recommend installing ObsPy using conda because:

 * the life should be easier;
 * separate your install from your system default Python, meaning you can
   experiment without breaking your OS;
 * modules should be compiled correctly

If you do not have either a miniconda or anaconda installation you can follow
the |conda-install| instructions.

.. |conda-install| raw:: html

  <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/" target="_blank">conda-install</a>

If you do not already have a conda environment we recommend creating one
with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n obspy python=3.6
    conda activate obspy
    conda install obspy
    conda install bottleneck

For installing PyMPA you can simply clone the git repository and try it within your obspy env:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:avuan/PyMPA37.git


On a Linux system for installing conda, obspy, bottleneck and mirror the PyMPA code follow this commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ./Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source Ëœ.bashrc
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda create -n obspy37 python=3.7
    source activate obspy37
    conda install obspy
    conda install bottleneck
    mkdir test_obspy1.2.0
    cd test_obspy1.2.0
    git clone https://github.com/avuan/PyMPA37
