# input parameters for runnig 27 version
# line1 = stations available,
# line2 = channels available,
# line3 = networks available,
# line4 = low bandpass filter frequency,
# line5 = high bandpass filter frequency,
# line6 = sample tolerance in detecting maximum cft amplitude for each channel,
# line7 = cross-correlation threshold to be overcome by cft,
# line8 = min number of channels overcoming the cross-correlation threshold,
# line9 = template duration(s),
# line10 = UTCDateTime.DEFAULT_PRECISION (number of digits in fractions of seconds),
# line11 = string variable containing the directory name for continuous 24h waveforms,
# line12 = string variable for templates' directory,
# line13 = string variable for travel times directory,
# line14 = processing days (starting date[col. 1-3 year month day] and number of days to process [col. 4]),
# line15 = filename for zmap catalog,
# line16 = template start number,
# line17 = template stop number(if line16==0  and line17==0 all templates are processed,
# line18 = multiplying factor for MAD to determine threshold 
# line 19 = multiplying factor to remove daily cft channels with std greater than (average std from all channels * factor at at line 19) 
# line 20 = multiplying factor to remove daily cft channels with std smaller than (average std from all channels * factor at at line 20)
# line 21 = maximum number of templates to be used in template matching (choice is made preferring the closest channels)
# line 22 = number of chunks per day (1=86400s, 2=43200, 3=28800, 4=21600, 6=14400 etc... icreasing the factor allows reducing memory consumption)
