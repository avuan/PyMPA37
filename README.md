PyMPA
===

**a software package for phase match filtering**


### Abstract

The software package PyMPA is an open source seismological software. It consists of some separate utilities for data preparation, the main program pympa38.mac.py, and post-processing tools to obtain a catalog and verify events. PyMPA is designed to detect microseismicity from the cross-correlation of continuous data and templates.

### Motivation and significance

The software was developed in the framework of a bilateral project between Italy and Japan 2013-2015 "Detection of slow slip events and space-time cluster analysis of low magnitude tremors preceding the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake and the 2012 Emilia seismic sequence in Italy", and was co-funded by Ministero Affari Esteri (Italy) - Scientific and Technological Collaboration Executive Program. Further improvements to the code are planned wothin Project H2020 - SERA 2017-2019 http://www.sera-eu.org/. 


### System requirements

Python installed to run the program (version 2.6 or more) is required [http://python.org].
Python 3 with Obspy installed (since version 0.10.1) is supported.
Installing Obspy implies Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib libraries. For details on installing Obspy, please, consult the [official guide] (https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki).
